# TheECGaming Portfolio Site

Note my site is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

It uses the TALL stack (Yes I use PHP).

I am using Laravel 10, AlpineJS, Livewire, and TailwindCSS.

I started with Jetstream as I plan to use it for the admin panel, so I can post my portfolio items, blog posts, and other things in a simpler way.

I also plan on using S3 for storing my portfolio items, which will allow me to store videos for example and have them transcoded to different formats and sizes, including making thumnails using coconut.
